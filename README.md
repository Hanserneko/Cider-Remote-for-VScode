# Cider Remote

This is an unofficial remote for Cider Player that works on VScode

## Requirement

    Cider player for Windows[version >= 2.6.0(been tested)]

## How to use

Make sure the Cider player is on and the WebSockets API is enabled.
If 'Require API Tokens' is enabled, please create a token for VScode then fill it into extension setting.
You can use command or buttons in status-bar.

## Notice

This is not an official extension for Cider Player.
It may cause Bugs.
It uses the WebSocket API, so it should be available on Linux and macOS. However, I have only tested it on Windows. If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Hanserneko/Cider-Remote-for-VScode/issues).
